This mini project demonstrates the working of a 1101 Sequence Detector of Non-overlapping type using Xilinx Vivado platform. The detector is designed using a Mealy State Machine (FSM model) 
where the current input is varied after every 10ns to ensure the correct input containing the sequence in some part of the input. The output signal gets high when the sequence is detected.
